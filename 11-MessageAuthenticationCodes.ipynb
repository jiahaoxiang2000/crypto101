Then, the attacker tells the hash function to produce a digest. Again, the hash function appends a padding, so we're now at $k∥m∥p∥m'∥p'$. The attacker outputs that digest as the tag. That is exactly the same thing as what happens when you try to compute the tag for the message $m∥p∥m'$ under the secret key k.
