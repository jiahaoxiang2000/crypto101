    "It's a hybrid cryptosystem: it uses both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms in unison. For example, asymmetric algorithms such as signature algorithms can be used to **authenticate** peers, while **public key encryption** algorithms or Diffie-Hellman exchanges can be used to negotiate shared secrets and **authenticate certificates**. On the symmetric side, **stream** ciphers (both native ones and block ciphers in a **mode of operation**) are used to encrypt the actual data being transmitted, and **MAC** algorithms are used to authenticate that data."

    "SSL 2.0 made the mistake of not authenticating handshakes. This made it easy to mount downgrade attacks. A downgrade attack is a man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker modifies the handshake messages that negotiate which cipher suite is being used. That way, he can force the clients to set up the connection using an insecure block cipher."
